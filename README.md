# tg-poggers
tg-poggers is a Telegram bot that sends a POGGERS (Twitch emote) sticker at the right time, i.e. when one of the triggers is activated.

Triggers are strings of text contained in `triggers.txt` (one per line). If one of the triggers is contained in a message the bot will send the sticker.
